It's basically my presentation card.  
Has a simple Ruby on Rails framework and uses Bootstrap for the CSS, taking advantage of some of its fancy features, such as Responsive Design, Javascript features (dropdown menus and the fancy photo carousel). Has a couple of additional Gems for fonts, icons and other features.   
Open for improvements, so I'd like to hear suggestions.
